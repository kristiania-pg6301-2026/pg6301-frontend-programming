# PG6301 Web Development and API design

Welcome to this course in Web Development and API Design. In this course, we will
look at creating single-page applications with React backed by APIs implemented
with React. The application will store data in MongoDB and be deployed on Clever Cloud

- [Lectures](#lectures)
- [Reference material](#reference-material)

## Understanding the course

In this course, we expect you to become proficient at building web applications
with JavaScript, React and Hono. During the lectures, you will see live coding
of how such applications may be constructed and many topics will be explained
along the way.

The course will not have slides, but all the lectures will be recorded and made
available on Canvas. Each lecture will consist of 10-15 commits which will be
available on GitHub for student's reference.

There are many topics that we believe are more suitable for self-study than
classroom explanations, and you will not always be shown how all topics are used
in a more general situation. _You will be expected to master some such topics
to get a top grade at the exam_. In order to be prepared for the exam, you have
to follow the lectures, but you also have to be able to solve new problems and
find relevant information along the way. To be able to do this, it's extremely
valuable for you to follow the exercises along the lectures.

The lectures will be recorded and the recordings will be available to students in Panopto in Canvas.

### The example applications

In the course we will mainly be building two example applications:

- The todo-application: This is a very common example, and you can see lots of examples
  using this online. The application lets to users create tasks and mark them as
  complete. In addition, we will be adding details to the tasks and give access to
  tasks to other users
- Movie reviews

## Lectures

### Lecture 1: Programming skills

[![Lecture 1 Mentimeter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_1-mentimenter-yellow)]()

[![Lecture 1 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_1-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/01)
[![Lecture 1 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_1-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/01)
[![Lecture 1 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_1-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-1)

In this lecture, we will look at some popular and effective software engineering practices:

- Test-driven development: Alternating between writing testing code and production code, writing the test code first
- Pair-programming: Two developers working together on the same code with one keyboard and mouse, preferably alternating frequently who is at the keyboard
- Refactoring: Improving the structure of the code without changing the behavior, preferably using refactoring support in the IDE
- Continuous integration: Sharing the code frequently with the rest of the team, preferably running automated checks whenever the code is pushed

These are some of the practices of Extreme Programming, the first Agile method to be widely documented and used.

### Lecture 2: Programming tools

[![Lecture 2 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_2-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/02)
[![Lecture 2 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_2-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/02)
[![Lecture 2 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_2-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-2)
[![Lecture 2 issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_2-issues-green)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/milestone/2)

This lecture covers GitHub Actions, Pull requests, GitHub issues and Code Reviews. This completes most of the practices from Extreme Programming:

- Pair programming
- Test-driven development
- Simple design
- Refactoring
- Continuous integration
- Coding standard
- (Collective code ownership)
- (Sustainable pace)

### Lecture 3: A tour of React, Hono and Clever Cloud

[![Lecture 3 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_3-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/03)
[![Lecture 3 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_3-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/03)
[![Lecture 3 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_3-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-3)

We explore the most important parts to the whole application up and running on
a server. This lecture will be _way too fast to understand_ and will serve merely
as a teaser to topics that will be important through the course. After the
lecture, you will only be expected to know the basics of how to create a React
application with Vite and React Router

### Lecture 4: React, `useState` and props

[![Lecture 4 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_4-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/04)
[![Lecture 4 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_4-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/04)
[![Lecture 4 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_4-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-4)

We will review the React topics from the last lecture: Creating a React app,
creating functional components and using props, state and effects.

#### Reference material

- [Fireship: React in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/Tn6-PIqc4UM)
- [Fireship: every React hook](https://youtu.be/TNhaISOUy6Q)

### Lecture 5: `useEffect`, `useRef` and React Router

[![Lecture 5 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_5-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/05)
[![Lecture 5 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_5-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/05)
[![Lecture 5 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_5-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-5)

We will continue on the React topics from the last lecture of creating components.
We will use the `useEffect` and `useRef` hooks to set up interaction between our app and the DOM-objects in the browser
in order to create a Dialog component using the HTML `<dialog />` element
We will also look at navigating in the app with React Router.

### Lecture 6: Implementing a React backend with Hono

[![Lecture 6 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_6-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/06)
[![Lecture 6 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_6-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/06)
[![Lecture 6 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_6-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-6)

We will create an Hono server which serves a React application that uses an API implemented in [Hono](https://hono.dev/) to implement
functionality.
See [Convert to serve from Hono] on the steps to take the code from the
previous lecture to be served from Hono.

### Lecture 7: Publishing your application on Clever Cloud

[![Lecture 7 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_7-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/07)

[![Lecture 7 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_7-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-7)

In this lecture, we will upload a simple web application to a cloud service and look at automatic deploys.
See [the steps to deploy to Clever Cloud](#deploying-to-clever-cloud).

In this lecture, we also look at ways to make sure our code is good, from formatting, to linting, to testing.
We will look at the tools husky, prettier and Typescript. We will also be using GitHub to run our quality
checks automatically.

### Lecture 8: Communication between client and server

[![Lecture 8 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_8-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/08)
[![Lecture 8 reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_8-reference_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/reference/08)
[![Lecture 8 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_8-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-8)

In this lecture, we will start from a blank application to review what we have covered so far. This will also give us
some chance to deal with some information we have glossed over about the communication between the client and the server.

In this lecture, we will also hand out the assignment for the course on
[Mattermost](https://mattermost.kristiania.no/it-h2024/channels/3s-pg6301-webutvikling-og-api-design)

**Reference material:**

In this lecture, we will be seeing Promises and async/await a lot more. This can be confusing and I recommend these
video descriptions:

- [Fireship.io video on Async/await and promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3tm0quoqE)
- [The JavaScript Event Loop (Jake Archibald)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0)

### Lecture 9: Storing data MongoDB

[![Lecture 9 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_9-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/09)

[![Lecture 9 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_9-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-9)

In this lecture, we learn how to store and retrieve data in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). See [reference notes for MongoDB](#mongodb)

**Reference material:**

- [MongoDB Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vPt7GI-2kc) - very useful and brief
- [MongoDB in 100 seconds (Fireship.io)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bt_y4Loofg)

### Lecture 10: Who's your user? OpenID Connect

[![Lecture 10 Mentimeter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_10-mentimenter-yellow)](https://www.menti.com/)

[![Lecture 10 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_10-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/10)

[![Lecture 10 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_10-exercise-pink)](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-10)

In this lecture we will implement "log in with Google"-functionality. We will also explore other identity
services that also implement OpenID Connect, such as LinkedIn and Microsoft Entra ID.

### Lecture 11: Completing OpenID Connect and MongoDB

[![Lecture 11 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_11-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/11)

We were unable to fully complete the contents of lecture 9 and 10 so we will complete this this week, working with [Open-ID Connect](#openid-connect---log-on-with-google) and [MongoDB](#mongodb).

There is no separate exercise for this lecture - instead: make sure that you complete the exercises for lecture 7 through 10.

### Lecture 12: Repetition of everything

[![Lecture 12 Mentimeter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_12-mentimenter-yellow)](https://www.menti.com/al3cqrg2gh6g)

[![Lecture 12 code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_12-lecture_code-blue)](https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming/tree/lecture/12)

[![Lecture 12 exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lecture_12-exercise-pink)](./exercises/exam-prep.md)

This week's lecture, we will talk a [little about the exam](./exercises/exam-prep.md).
We start then with a simple map and then discuss how to move forward based on the wishes
of the audience, so the lecture has no reference code.

For the exercise-time start on the last exercise that you haven't completed. You can also work on the exam prep.

## Reference material

### Creating a React application

This list of commands:

1. Creates a `package.json`-file
2. Installs [Vite](https://vite.dev) which transforms `index.html` + `.tsx`-files to JavaScript
3. Installs [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to check the correctness of your code
4. Installs [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to check the coding style of your code
5. Installs [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) which runs checks before each login
6. Installs the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) testing library

```shell
npm init -y
npm install -D vite
npm pkg set type=module
npm install react react-dom
npm pkg set scripts.dev=vite

npm install -D typescript
npm install -D @types/react @types/react-dom
npx tsc --init --jsx react

npm install -D prettier
npx prettier --write .
npm pkg set scripts.test="tsc --noEmit && prettier --check ."

npm install -D husky
npx husky init

npm install vitest

```

#### Minimal `index.html`

```html
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
  <script src="src/main.tsx" type="module"></script>
</html>
```

#### Minimal `src/main.tsx`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<h1>Hello React</h1>);
```

#### Commiting to Git

1. Create a `.gitignore`-file that excludes `node_modules`, `dist` and `.idea`
2. Make sure all files are formatted with Prettier

## Deploying your application to the internet

You can either deploy using [GitHub pages](#a-deployment-to-github-pages) or [Clever Cloud](https://clever.cloud).
GitHub pages is the simplest option, but it cannot run a database. If you want to include a database, you need
to use Clever Cloud or a similar service

### A. Deployment to GitHub Pages

<details>

#### Minimal `vite.config.ts`

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  // This has to be equal to the name of your repository
  // For example, since this repository is https://github.com/kristiania-pg6301-2026/pg6301-frontend-programming,
  //  `base` has to be `/pg6301-frontend-programming`
  base: "/pg6301-frontend-programming",
});
```

#### Minimal `.github/workflows/publish-to-github-pages.yml`

<details>

```yml
on:
  push:
    # Only deploy when the branch name matches one of these
    # You probably only need `main`, the others are provided to work with the lecture
    branches: ["main", "reference/*", "lecture/*"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 22.x, cache: "npm" }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm test
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

    permissions:
      id-token: write # to verify the deployment originates from an appropriate source
      pages: write # to deploy to Pages
      contents: read # to checkout private repositories
```

</details>
</details>

### B. Deploying to Clever Cloud

<details>

#### Deploying to Clever Cloud

By running on Clever Cloud, you can have a server-side application which accesses a database.

In order to deploy to Clever Cloud you need to register an account with the [Clever Cloud](https://clever.cloud)
organization created for the class to avoid cloud bills.

#### Creating a Hono Application

This sets up your application to have a subdirectory for the server which should have node modules installed and be
started by Clever Cloud.

This list of commands:

1. Sets up the scripts to build and start the application on Clever Cloud
2. Creates a directory for the server with a separate `package.json`
3. Adds dependencies on [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
4. Creates the scripts to develop and run the server

```shell
npm pkg set scripts.postinstall="cd server && npm install --include=dev"
npm pkg set scripts.build="vite build"
npm pkg set scripts.start="cd server && npm start"

npm install -D @types/node

mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y

npm install hono @hono/node-server
npm install --save-dev tsx
npm pkg set type=module
npm pkg set scripts.dev="tsx --watch index.ts"
npm pkg set scripts.start="tsx index.ts"

```

**`server/index.ts`**

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { serveStatic } from "@hono/node-server/serve-static";

const app = new Hono();
// `serveStatic` makes Hono serve the output from `vite build`
app.use("*", serveStatic({ root: "../dist" }));

serve(app);
```

**Deploying to Clever Cloud**

To set up your application to run with Clever Cloud:

....

</details>

### Handling API calls:

<details>

**Make Vite proxy (forward) calls to /api to port 3000 when running locally:**

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: { "/api": "http://localhost:3000" },
  },
});
```

**In React: fetching data:**

```jsx
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
async function loadTasks() {
  const res = await fetch("/api/tasks");
  setTasks(await res.json());
}

useEffect(() => {
  loadTasks();
}, []);
```

**In Hono: fetching data:**

```jsx
app.get("/api/tasks", (c) => {
  return c.json(tasks);
});
```

**In React: updating data:**

```jsx
const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
async function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  await fetch("/api/tasks", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ description }),
  });
}
```

**In Hono: updating data:**

```jsx
app.post("/api/tasks", async (c) => {
  const task = await c.req.json();
  tasks.push(task);
  return c.newResponse(null, 201);
});
```

</details>

## Testing

#### Snapshot testing - check that a view is rendered correctly

For testing react code, I recommend [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

<details>

To test with react, install devDependencies `@testing-library/react` and `jsdom`

1. `npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react jsdom`
2. Add the following to your `vite.config.js`:

   ```js
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       environment: "jsdom",
     },
   });
   ```

- Use `render` from `@testing-library/react` to instantiate components
- Use `expect(RenderResult.baseElement).toMatchSnapshot()` for a test that checks that nothing has changed
- Use `RenderResult.baseElement.{querySelector,querySelectorAll}` to find DOM elements to inspect in the test
- You can also use [`RenderResult.findBy{Text,LabelText}`](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about) to find elements - this retries for up to one second
- Use `fireEvent` from `@testing-library/react` to create change, submit and other events
- Use [`vitest.fn()`](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking) to create a [Mock](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking) function that can be used to verify that an event was triggered

```javascript
import { afterEach, describe, expect, it, vitest } from "vitest";
import { cleanup, render } from "@testing-library/react";
import React from "react";

// Without this, each test will extend the web page from the previous instead of starting over
afterEach(cleanup);

it("matches snapshot", async () => {
  const app = render(
    <MemoryRouter initialEntries={["/"]}>
      <MoviesRoutes fetchMovies={() => movies} />,
    </MemoryRouter>,
  );
  expect(app.baseElement).toMatchSnapshot();
  expect(
    [...app.baseElement.querySelectorAll("h3")].map((c) => c.textContent),
  ).toEqual(["Barbie", "Oppenheimer"]);
});
```

</details>

#### Simulate events

<details>

```javascript
import { afterEach, describe, expect, it, vitest } from "vitest";
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from "@testing-library/react";
import React from "react";

// Without this, each test will extend the web page from the previous instead of starting over
afterEach(cleanup);

it("handles event", async () => {
  const handleClick = vitest.fn();
  const app = render(
    <button onClick={() => handleClick(123)}>Click me</button>,
  );
  fireEvent.click(await app.findByText("Click me"));
  expect(handleClick).toBeCalledWith(123);
});
```

</details>

#### Testing Hono endpoints

For testing Hono files, I recommend [the Hono test guide](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/testing)

## OpenID Connect - Log on with Google

See the [notes for exercise 10](./exercises/EXERCISES.md#exercise-10) for notes on how OpenID Connect works.

## MongoDB

### Reading data from MongoDb

<details>

Run `cd server` and `npm install mongodb` to install the MongoDB dependency. In this example, we use the `sample_mflix` database that comes with [Atlas MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)

**Example of a get-route to retrieve data from MongoDB**

```js
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URL);
const connection = await client.connect();

const moviesCollection = connection.db("sample_mflix").collection("movies");

app.get("/api/movies", async (c) => {
  return c.json(
    await moviesCollection
      .find({ year: { $gt: 2000, $lt: 2010 }, countries: "Norway" })
      .sort({ metacritic: -1 })
      .limit(100)
      .toArray(),
  );
});
```

In this example, the database username, password and databasename is provided in `MONGODB_URL`. During local development, this value should be placed in a `server/.env`-file, which should be added to `.gitignore`. Update the `dev` script in the server to `tsx --env-file .env --watch index.ts` to read environment variables at startup.

When deploying to Clever Cloud, add `MONGODB_URL` to ...

When deploying to Clever Cloud using [Atlas MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/), you also need to make sure Clever Cloud has network access to your database under Security > Network Access. Here, you need to add `0.0.0.0/0` as an IP-address.

## Tools

### IntellJ shortcuts

<details>
These are some of the most versatile keyboard shortcuts in IntelliJ. There are many more, but learning these 12 will really speed up your code

| Shortcut (Windows)   | Shortcut (Mac)      | Command                                    |
